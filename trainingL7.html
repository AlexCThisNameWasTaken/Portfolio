				<h2>Training Packages</h2>
				
				<p>We offer several types of training packages. Whether your horse is completely green, needs a tune up, or is starting in a new discipline, we can customize a training package to meet your needs.</p>
				
				<h3>Full-Time Training</h3>
				<p>Horses in full time training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals tailored to the owner. Full Time training includes full-board.</p>
				
				<h3>Part-time Training</h3>
				<p>Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. Part-time training can be packaged with a full or partial care board.</p>
				
				<h3>Individual Training Sessions</h3>
				<p>Individual training sessions are available for both borders and clients who would like to haul in. Individual training sessions are not packaged with a board.</p>
